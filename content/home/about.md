# About me

I'm a PhD student and HCI researcher, specializing in usable security and privacy. Currently, my research is focused on understanding unauthorized access to mobile devices. 

I also regularly work on HCI methodology, and other HCI application areas, like accessibility. 

I'm advised by [Luis Carrico](https://ciencias.ulisboa.pt/en/perfil/lmcarrico) and [Tiago Guerreiro](https://tjvguerreiro.github.io/). In summer 2014, I interned at the IBM TJ Watson Research Center, with [Shari Trewin](http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-trewin).
