# About me

I'm a PhD student and usable security researcher. I try to understand people in order to build security tools that leverage their psychological needs.

I also regularly work on HCI methodology, and other HCI application areas, like accessibility. 

I'm advised by [Luis Carrico](https://ciencias.ulisboa.pt/en/perfil/lmcarrico) and [Tiago Guerreiro](https://tjvguerreiro.github.io/). In summer 2014, I interned at the IBM TJ Watson Research Center, with [Shari Trewin](http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view.php?person=us-trewin).
